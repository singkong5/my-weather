# Android My Weather
A simple weather app that showcases the use of modern Android application development methodologies.
My Weather app uses the [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API to get the weather forecast. Open Meteo offers free access for non-commercial use and no developer key required.
My Weather app also uses the [Google Place Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete) to search cities based on the query input and [Google Geocoding Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview#place-id) to get lat/long of the city that's selected.

To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the Google API Documentation for instructions.
Once you have the key, add this line to the gradle.properties file, either in your user home directory (usually ~/.gradle/gradle.properties on Linux and Mac) or in the project's root folder:
```
google_api_key=<your Google access key>
```
